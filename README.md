# Project Description
The "Voice-Controlled Home Automation" project is designed to enable users to interact with home devices using voice commands.
The project is composed of two subsystems:

## Subsystem 1 Description
When user enter the room and issue the "GOOD MORNING" voice command (Laptopâ€™s microphone â€“ the laptop will process the command using voice recognition), the system responds by turning on the light 
and playing a predetermined song on the laptopâ€™s speaker. The voice command "GOODNIGHT" initiates the shutdown sequence. This command triggers the system to turn off the lights and play a designated
song to facilitate a soothing atmosphere. 

## Subsystem 2 Description
The user can open/close the window shutter (motor) by making a specific gesture (infrared sensor).
